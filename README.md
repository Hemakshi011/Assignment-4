# Assignment-4
This program allows the user to choose from a menu of options:

1. Print the deck of cards
2. Search for a card in the deck
3. Deal 5 random cards from the deck
4. Sort the deck of cards
0. Exit the program

The program uses the `Card` class to represent each card and the deck of cards as an array of `Card` objects. The `Card` class has the following methods:

- `createDeck`: creates a new deck of cards
- `printCard`: prints the rank and suit of a card
- `printDeck`: prints all the cards in a deck
- `sameCard`: checks if two cards are the same
- `compareCard`: compares two cards based on rank and suit
- `sortDeck`: sorts a deck of cards based on rank and suit
- `findCard`: searches for a card in a deck
- `dealCards`: deals a specified number of random cards from a deck

The program uses a `Scanner` object to read input from the user and a `Random` object to generate random numbers for dealing cards.
